# ‚ù§Ô∏è Challenges
# As a developer, I can create a hash called my_phone using the Ruby method .new.
my_phone = Hash.new

# As a developer, I can add five key:value pairs of app names and their descriptions to my hash.

my_phone[:maps] = "navigating instructions"
my_phone[:duoling] = "learn new languages"
my_phone[:whatsapp] = "interactive messaging"
my_phone[:instagram] = "social media app"
# p my_phone

# As a developer, I can return a value from my_phone by passing in the name of a key.
# p my_phone[:spotify]

# As a developer, I can update two keys in my_phone.
my_phone[:itunes] = my_phone.delete(:spotify)
my_phone[:duolingo] = my_phone.delete(:duoling)
# p my_phone
