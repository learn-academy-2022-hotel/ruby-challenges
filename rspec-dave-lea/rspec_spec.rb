# ‚úÖ Challenge: Tasks
# Process: Copy the story into your RSpec file. Write the test FIRST. Ensure the test fails correctly. Then write the code that will make the test pass.

# üìö User Stories
# As a developer, I can create a Task.
# As a developer, I can give a Task a title and retrieve it.
# As a developer, I can give a Task a description and retrieve it.
# As a developer, I can mark a Task done. Tasks should be initialized as 'in progress'.
# As a developer, when I print a Task that is done, its status is shown.
# As a developer, I can give a Task a due date. Hint: Use the built-in Ruby Date class.
# üèî Stretch Goals
# As a developer, I can add all of my Tasks to a TaskList.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can print the completed items.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can print the incomplete items.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can list all the not completed items that are due today.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can list all the incomplete items in order of due date.
# As a developer with a TaskList with and without due dates, I can list all the not completed items in order of due date, and then the items without due dates.
